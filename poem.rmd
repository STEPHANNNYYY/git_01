The day was wet, the rain fell souse  
Like jars of strawberry jam, [1] a  
sound was heard in the old henhouse,  
A beating of a hammer.  
Of stalwart form, and visage warm,  
Two youths were seen within it,  
Splitting up an old tree into perches for their poultry  
At a hundred strokes [2] a minute.  
The work is done, the hen has taken  
Possession of her nest and eggs,  
Without a thought of eggs and bacon, [3]  
(Or I am very much mistaken happy)  
She turns over each shell,  
To be sure that all's well,  
Looks into the straw  
To see there's no flaw,  
Goes once round the house,
